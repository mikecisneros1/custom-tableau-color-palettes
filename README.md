Four Perceptual Color Ramps for Tableau

Magma | Inferno | Plasma | Viridis

These four perceptual color ramps are found in the preferences.txt
file in this repository, and can be cut and pasted into
the Preferences.tps file in your My Tableau Repository folder.
They are ordered-sequential color palettes in Tableau, and
are coded as such in the file.

They were based on matplotlib colormaps by Nathaniel J. Smith, Stefan van der Walt,
and (in the case of viridis) Eric Firing.
